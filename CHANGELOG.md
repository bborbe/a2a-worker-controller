## Unreleased

- feat: initial service scaffold
- feat: define the backend-independent control API (`create` / `list` / `stop`)
- refactor: drop the skeleton's Kafka and BoltDB wiring and its demo endpoints; log via slog
- fix: remove the StatefulSet and KafkaUser manifests — the controller is stateless and has no Kafka
- fix: pin Go 1.27.2 in `go.mod` and the Dockerfile so CI's `vulncheck` matches the local toolchain
